### Hello, Everyone!

My name is Viktor (Victor). I am Russian student. I speak Russian ([native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language)), English ([~Upper Intermediate](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-levels)) and German ([>Anfanger (A1-A2)](https://www.goethe.de/ins/in/de/spr/kon/stu.html)).

p.s. My name is spelled Victor in English, but because my country adopted the French idea of transliteration (I don't actually know how it's called) - I am Viktor. So it would not be a mistake if you call me Victor/Viktor.

You can contact me via [Telegram](https://t.me/Grey31) or [Email](mail@kerdoku.top). I won't eat you if you're not watermelons.

I enjoy studying and I believe it will help me achieve all my goals.
I think I am good at Informatics, Economy, Physics and [Maths](https://www.thesaurus.com/e/grammar/math-vs-maths/#:~:text=Math%20is%20the%20preferred%20term,places%20while%20maths%20was%20elsewhere.)
